This is a basic JavaScript quiz
There are 10 questions with multiple choice answers
There is a 5 minutes timer that begins when the user starts the quiz, if a question is answered incorrectly 30 seconds are subtracted from the timer
After answering all the questions or when the timer runs out, the user is shown how many questions they answered correctly and asked for a name for the leaderboard
The leaderboard can be viewed from the beginning or ending screens, it is stored locally and is sorted in descending order of score

Transitions between screens are accomplished by using a bootstrap carousel
Some jQuery was used to control the carousel
